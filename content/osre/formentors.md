Still under constructions. Stay tuned!

Please read [the instructions](/osredocs/formentors) for participating mentors. The main difference from last year is that each project is now on a separate page. Projects now use tags to associate with a particular year and whether it is a UC project or a reproducibility project (or both). More tags can be used to associate the project with a particular research area, e.g. chip design, storage systems, data science.

There is a mentor-only mailing list ... Please write us an email if you want to be added to this list.

For new research groups wishing to join OSRE: just create one or more projects (see [instructions](/osredocs/formentors)). 

{{% callout note %}}
Your project needs to
