# How to apply to the OSRE

1. Take a look at [projects](/osre#projects)...
2. Contact mentor(s), send CV, and motivation. Time window. Encouraged to propose to a max of two project proposals.
3. Mentors might have you take a technical test, just an initial step. No cheating!
4. Mentors announce whether you passed the test. Collaborate on writing the proposal.
    - Guide you through project software
    - Discuss project objectives and how to achieve them. Time window.
    - Pointers to documentation, reference research
5. Proposal must contain:
    - Detailed plan of work (175 or 375 hours)
    - Well defined tasks and their objectives, list of deliverables
    - Timewindow for mentor feedback, application deadeline
6. Proposal will be evaluated and ranked by mentors, feedback given to OSRE Admins. Admins request slots to GSoC and other sponsors by deadline. Results are made public by date.
